I created this in response to a manager request to be able to control HyperV access directly, and as soon as possible.
This quick and dirty console menu program is my result. There's definitely more efficient and better ways to do this,
and I may come back to it later, but it works effectively enough for now.

The VM-Management-Console allows users to disconnect or connect the Hyper-V Virtual Switch from individual virtual machines
(essentially the equivalent of unplugging the ethernet cable from a workstation) in a relatively user friendly manner.
Due to COVID we have had an increased number of employees requiring work from home, but management is not entirely comfortable
with allowing 24 hr access to work resources for some of them. Because of this, we have automated procedures that disconnect
the Virtual Switch after business hours. This simple, quick, dirty solution allows managers to control access on weekends or
after hours on a granular, non-destructive level.
